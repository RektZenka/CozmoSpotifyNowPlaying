# CozmoSpotifyNowPlaying
now playing for the anki cozmo robot
# installation
## setup
for an ideal experience, connect to cozmo wifi through a wifi card or a cheap adapter, since this isnt very intensive, and use ethernet to connect to your main internet.

make sure to have python 3.7.9 installed, other versions might work but i havent tested.
(could be from the microsoft store, or from python directly)
## installing libraries
once installed, run this command to install the neccessary libraries for spotify and cozmo

``` pip install spotipy pycozmo ```
